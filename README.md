# :pray:  Hi, I’m Sanjeev Yogi :pray:


Full stack web developer with experience using backend and frontend technologies like Node, Ruby on Rails, React, and React-native. A graduate of Colorado State University and Flatiron School (Denver) with a passion for art, design, and technology. Emerging from a career in art and architecture combined with a more technology-oriented construction side, I opted for a career in software engineering which allows me to explore it all - art, creativity, and technology. After completing my 15 weeks software engineering immersive course with the Flatiron School, I am relishing my newfound ability to code and create new things. Continuously learning and dedicated to perfecting my craft.
